With this version we are switching to the standard libs/nmea0183/ library.
The original library is still in src/OLD/nmea0183
Please note that there are 5 files that are different in various ways.
One file clarifies a missing nema field.
If there is some problem with nmea we will have to go back to the original files and look, we may have to start using those files, so keep them around.
